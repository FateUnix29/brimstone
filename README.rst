Brimstone
=========
A brand new, CLI-based mod manager for Brick Rigs, and possibly beyond.

Be more specific! What is this?
-------------------------------
| Brimstone is a nickname for Brick Rigs Instance Manager, abbreviated as ``BRIM``. The mission is to create a fast, open source, easy-to-use CLI mod manager with an API.
| This also allows for future GUI adaptations.
|
| It allows you to install, remove, swap around, mods and modpacks for the supported games.
| (As you could guess by the name of the project, currently only Brick Rigs!)

Okay, that sounds neat, what can it do?
---------------------------------------
As of writing this ``.rst`` file, absolutely nothing. I'm writing this from the very start of the project, with only *plans* on how it should be.
Here's what you can (hopefully) expect, but no promises:

* Install & uninstall mods
* Install & uninstall mod\ **packs**
* Swap modpacks in and out with ease
* Open source w/ documentation and API
* Search mods, libraries for mods, etc, with ease
* And more to come...!

Okay, any more ambitious plans for later?
-----------------------------------------
Certainly! Some of those would have to be:

* Support for other games
* GUI binding/app, demonstrating API usage
* Extensive API that allows Brimstone to be configured for games that aren't officially supported
* And a less ambitious one to end off on: User repositories.

Who's behind this?
------------------
| Hi! I'm Kite. I'm the guy that started this, and currently the sole maintainer of the project.
| I am known as `FateUnix29`_ on GitHub, or otherwise Copper. I do have a Discord, @kitethelunatic.

Okay, okay. Let's skip to the important stuff. Installation steps, please?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Completely, 100%, nonexistent! ðŸŽ‰
| (Don't worry, they'll appear once Brimstone is in a working order.)

What was the inspiration?
-------------------------
Other mod managers, the death of the oldest one by my friend TLM, the idea randomly popping into my head some time ago and not leaving, and of course, package managers such as ``pacman`` or ``apt``.

How can I contribute?
---------------------
Right now, the plan is that another GitHub repository is used, with extremely light-weight files that GitHub won't freak out over. It should be as simple as submitting a PR to that!

Any community?
--------------
Not yet, maybe when it actually picks up at least a *SMALL* following.
